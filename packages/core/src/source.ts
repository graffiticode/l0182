/**
 * Where a survey's data comes from.
 *
 * A program says which survey is being taken — `survey [id "you-can-choose" …]` — and nothing
 * about what is in it. The set of ideas, the title, the instructions and the bounds all live
 * out here, so that whoever takes the survey has not seen it before the first turn compiles.
 * That is the whole point of the split: a survey the taker could edit is not a survey.
 *
 * A survey is ONE JSON file per version, and everything the survey is lives in it: its ideas, its
 * title, its instructions and its bounds. CSV was readable here once and is not any more — it
 * carries a list and nothing else, so a survey stored that way had to fall back to generic
 * wording, which is the opposite of what a survey is for.
 *
 * A survey id names a SET of files, one per version of the survey: `you-can-choose-1.json`,
 * `you-can-choose-2.json`, and so on. Taking the survey draws one of them at random WITHOUT
 * replacement — a drawn file is marked taken until every file for that id has been taken, at
 * which point the marks clear and the cycle starts again — so that a survey with several
 * versions spreads its takers across them rather than piling onto whichever one sorts first.
 *
 * Two things make the draw survive the way the platform runs compiles:
 *
 * - **A session keeps its file.** Answering a survey rewrites the program (the response is
 *   written into it), so the program compiles a second time, and a second draw would check the
 *   response against ideas its taker never saw. `session-id` is carried through to here, and a
 *   session that has drawn before gets the same file back.
 * - **A file can be named outright.** `id "you-can-choose-7"` loads exactly that file, with no
 *   draw and no mark. That is the escape hatch when the memory below has been lost.
 *
 * The memory IS lossy: it is process-local, so a restart or a second server instance forgets it,
 * and a session that comes back afterwards is drawn for again. Refusing that case instead was
 * considered and is WRONG — a first turn may legitimately arrive with its answer already in it
 * ("answer the you-can-choose survey with …" through `create_item`), and a forgotten session and
 * a brand-new one are indistinguishable from here. Naming the version as the id is what makes an
 * answer immune. Making the memory durable means a store this language server does not have.
